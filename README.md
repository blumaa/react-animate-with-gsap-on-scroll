# React- Animate with GSAP (Green Sock) and scrolling

This is a sample template for using gsap (green sock) animations in combination with React and scrolling. It is VERY basic and simple. It's merely meant to give you the idea of how to do it so that you can start working on your own.

## Motivation

As I was trying to animate using an onScroll technique, I started searching for different tutorials and resources related to GSAP and Green Sock and React. Mostly what I found were tutorials and threads on the [Green Sock forum ](https://greensock.com/forums/). I found a lot of stuff on using onScroll with Vanilla JavaScript. But there is a huge gap when it comes to using GSAP with React. This tutorial is small attempt to help fill that gap.
